# E-Commerce-App
This project simulates a simple e-commerce website with two main user roles: 
Admin: Manages products, categories, and users. 
User: Can browse products, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.  
Itâ€™s built on a full-stack Java framework using Spring Boot for backend, JSP for frontend views, and MySQL for persistent data storage.
